 * everything self-consistent: `history.get(n)` is recomputed from the edited text and still
 * matches. That is exactly the bug that shipped in `dataview`/`tasknotes` — new body, unchanged
 * version, so the version no longer identified a body and every install read as customized.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FAILS: you changed DEFAULT_AGENT_PROMPT (or one of its building blocks). Either bump
 * AGENT_PROMPT_VERSION and retain the old text as a new constant (see the doc in prompts.ts), or
 * — if the edit is genuinely cosmetic and no shipped build carries the old text — update the
