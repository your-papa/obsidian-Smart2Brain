 * - `lexical` — BM25 only. The default, and what the search modal shows first.
 * - `semantic` — embeddings only, with **no lexical leg at all**. Not the same as

 *   single-source branch when `lexicalResults` is empty, which skips RRF
 *   rank-mixing and raises the title boost (`SEMANTIC_ONLY_TITLE_BOOST_MAX`).
 * - `hybrid` — both legs fused at `SEMANTIC_SOURCE_WEIGHT`.
 *
 * The modal's Tab toggle picks `lexical` ↔ `semantic`, because by the time a user
 * toggles it they have already seen and rejected the lexical ordering.
 *
 * The agent's `search_notes` tool takes this as a **per-call parameter** rather than a
 * setting, defaulting to `lexical`. There is no globally correct choice to configure:
 * measured on the graded benchmark, semantic wins the core tier (δ=-0.0537) while hybrid
 * wins the hard tier (+0.0493), and neither difference is significant. The caller holds
 * the query context that decides it, so the model picks per call and escalates from
 * `lexical` when wording rather than content is the obstacle.
