/**
 * Wires LangChain-core's global AsyncLocalStorage singleton to a real
 * `node:async_hooks` instance.
 *
 * Why this is needed:
 * LangGraph threads the active `RunnableConfig` through nested runs via
 * `AsyncLocalStorageProviderSingleton`. Helpers like `getCurrentTaskInput()`,
 * `getStore()`, and `getWriter()` read config from it. deepagents' `task` tool
 * calls `getCurrentTaskInput()` **without** passing config
 * (`node_modules/deepagents/dist/langsmith-DjCMSywL.js`), so it depends entirely
 * on the singleton being backed by a working AsyncLocalStorage.
 *
 * LangChain only initializes that singleton as a side effect of importing
 * `@langchain/core/context`, which our bundle never imports (and the browser
 * build path deliberately does not, since browsers lack `node:async_hooks`).
 * Left uninitialized, the singleton falls back to `MockAsyncLocalStorage`, whose
 * `getStore()` returns `undefined` — so `getCurrentTaskInput()` throws:
 *
 *   "Config not retrievable. This is likely because you are running in an
 *    environment without support for AsyncLocalStorage."
 *
 * This surfaced as a subagent-delegation failure: the parent agent runs fine
 * (its config is passed explicitly), but the `task` tool's ALS-only lookup
 * throws when it tries to build the subagent's state.
 *
 * Obsidian desktop runs in Electron's renderer where `node:async_hooks` IS
 * available (see `src/lib/aiTransport.ts`). On mobile there is no
 * `node:async_hooks`, so `createAsyncLocalStorage()` returns a synchronous shim
 * that still satisfies the singleton's `getStore()`/`run()` contract for the
 * single-run agent flows the mobile UI drives.
 *
 * `initializeGlobalInstance` is a no-op if some other code already set an
 * instance, so importing this module is idempotent and safe to run first.
