/**
 * Ceiling on a single request made through this adapter.
 *
 * Neither `requestUrl` nor the native-fetch path has a timeout of its own, so an
 * unreachable host (VPN down, DNS blackhole, endpoint accepting the connection but
 * never responding) leaves the returned promise **permanently unsettled** rather
 * than rejecting. Every caller then waits forever: indexing freezes its progress
 * notice at the last count, and — because the abort check in the indexing loop runs
 * *after* the awaited embedding call — Cancel cannot stop it either.
 *
 * Sized from measured throughput rather than guessed. The slowest embedding model
 * benchmarked here runs at ~120 ms/chunk, and the largest default batch is 100
 * chunks (`getDefaultEmbeddingBatchSize`, OpenAI/OpenRouter), so a worst-case
 * legitimate batch is ~12 s. 60 s leaves a 5x margin over that while keeping the
 * wait short enough that a user learns something is wrong before giving up on the
 * app — the failure this bounds is "endpoint never answers", and every second past
 * the real ceiling is pure dead time.
 *
 * Note this bounds a *single* request, not a user-visible operation: provider SDKs
 * retry internally (the OpenAI client does several attempts with backoff), so an
 * unreachable host can still take a multiple of this before the caller sees an
 * error. That is the SDK's budget to spend, not ours to shorten here.
