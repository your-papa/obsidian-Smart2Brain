 * Edit mode: `cm.lineBlockAt(pos).top` is the line's document-space Y; scroll so

 *
 * Reading mode: `applyScroll(line)` DOES accurately top-pin the target line on a

 * viewport-top ~1px), so use it to reach the correct line — then nudge the
 * scroller up by `clientHeight * FRACTION` to drop the line to the anchor. Do
 * NOT anchor to `querySelector(".s2b-diff-section")`: reading view VIRTUALIZES,
 * so only sections near the viewport exist in the DOM, and the first one is
 * usually NOT the target group — navigating to a later change would scroll to
 * the wrong (earlier) change's section. Driving off `line` avoids that entirely.
