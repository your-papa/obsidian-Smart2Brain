/**
 * Shipped-version history for the *bundled* skills, so seeding can tell an untouched old

 *
 * Before #401 this didn't exist: `bootstrapDefaultSkills` skipped any skill whose folder was
 * already present, and `metadata.version` was decorative. An improvement to a bundled skill
 * therefore reached new vaults only — hit concretely when `explore-vault` gained reformulation
 * guidance in #399 and existing vaults had no way to receive it.
 *
 * Only bundled skills are covered. User-created skills have no shipped version and are never
 * touched by any of this.

/**
 * Fingerprints of bundled-skill bodies we shipped in a PREVIOUS version and no longer ship
 * as the current default.
 *
 * ## How to add an entry (do this when you change a bundled SKILL.md)
 *
 * 1. BEFORE your edit, copy the current SKILL.md verbatim to
 *    `src/skills/history/<name>-<version>.md` and `?raw`-import it here.
 * 2. Add `fingerprint(<import>)` under the skill's name and its *current* version.
 * 3. Then make your edit and bump `metadata.version` in the SKILL.md.
 *
 * A retained copy is preferred over a hand-transcribed hex literal because it stays
 * provably exact (`git diff` can compare it to history), at the cost of never-displayed
 * bundle text. If the retained copies ever add up (`bases` alone is ~21KB), collapse old
 * entries to hex literals — log `fingerprint(...)` once and inline the string.
 *
 * Skip step 1-2 and existing vaults will read their untouched copy as a user customization:
 * they'll get a notice asking them to reconcile by hand instead of a silent update. Skip step
 * 3 and it's the same outcome by a different route — the new body is recorded under the old
 * version, so the body that actually shipped under it is no longer in history at all.
 *
 * You do not have to remember any of this: `test/skills/shippedSkillHistory.test.ts` replays
 * every release tag and fails if a released body has no fingerprint or a version covers two
 * bodies. Retain only bodies that were actually *released* (present at a tag) — an
 * intermediate commit within one version never reached a vault, so pinning it protects
 * nothing.
 *
 * Entries are append-only — removing one has the same effect as never adding it.
