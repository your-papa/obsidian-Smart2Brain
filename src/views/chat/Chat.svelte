  /* Mobile keyboard handling.

     The composer is moved out of the leaf and re-parented to the workspace
     root (see `portalComposer`), then positioned with core's own formula for
     `.mobile-toolbar`:

       top: calc(100vh - var(--keyboard-height) - var(--mobile-toolbar-height))

     Why re-parent at all: `--keyboard-height` flips to the real height in one
     frame, but `.app-container` — and therefore `.view-content` — only reflows
     to `max-height: calc(100vh - var(--keyboard-height))` ~420ms later. Any
     descendant of the leaf is pinned to that stale box for the whole gap.
     Measured on-device: the composer sat frozen at bottom 802, behind the
     keyboard, while core's toolbar glided 822 → 796 → … → 487, then teleported
     to 487 when the container finally caught up. That is the "composer
     vanishes, then jumps up".

     Escaping the leaf is not optional: `.workspace-leaf` sets `contain: strict`,
     which establishes a containing block AND clips, so no amount of
     `position`/`inset` on our side gets out. Core's toolbar has no such problem
     because it is a direct child of `.app-container`, whose nearest positioned
     ancestor is `body` — a box that never goes stale. Re-parenting puts the
     composer in exactly that situation.

     Verified on-device: composer bottom goes 822 → 487 in a single frame and
     holds there for the entire keyboard animation, with the toolbar arriving
     to meet it. No transition — the value is already correct on frame one, and
     animating on top of it is what made earlier attempts drift. */
  /* The message area has the same staleness problem as the composer did: it is
     an `inset:0` child of `.view-content`, so while the keyboard opens it keeps
     the pre-keyboard height for ~420ms and its contents (the recommendations
     block in an empty chat) visibly hang low before snapping up. It cannot be
     portaled — it scrolls with the conversation and belongs to the leaf — so
     instead size it against the viewport, which is correct on frame one.
     `--s2b-view-top` is published by `portalComposer` (the leaf's own top edge,
     sampled while the keyboard is down); the bottom edge matches the composer's
     so the two stay flush. */

     horizontal placement (it can be in a sidebar split, not just full width).

     The bottom edge differs by keyboard state, because a different core element
     owns that band each time: with the keyboard UP it is `.mobile-toolbar`
     (`--mobile-toolbar-height`), with it DOWN it is the floating
     `.mobile-navbar` (52px + the safe-area inset, landing us 2px above the
     navbar top — the same clearance this view had before the composer was
     portaled). `max()` picks whichever edge is higher without a conditional.

     No `z-index`: core's navbar and toolbar live outside our host with
     `z-index: auto`, so leaving this unstyled lets them paint on top where they
     belong. An explicit stacking value here is what made the composer cover
