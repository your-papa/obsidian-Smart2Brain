/**
 * HNSW Vector Store
 *
 * IndexedDB-backed vector storage with HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index.
 * Provides O(log n) approximate nearest neighbor search instead of O(n) brute-force.
 *
 * Uses the `hnsw` npm package which is pure TypeScript (no native bindings) for the
 * in-memory graph. Persistence is ours: the document rows (with their vectors) and the
 * graph *topology* live in one IndexedDB database per index (see {@link DB_VERSION}).
 *
 * Note: The HNSW library uses numeric IDs internally, so we maintain a mapping
 * between string document IDs and numeric HNSW IDs.
 *
 * Memory model (#432): vectors are `Float32Array` end-to-end. Each vector is resident
 * exactly once, inside its graph node in this worker; the IndexedDB rows are the only
 * other copy and they are never materialised as a whole. Nothing in this file builds a
 * `number[]` from a vector.
