/**
 * Graph Layout Physics
 *
 * The force assembly behind the smart graph's d3-force simulation, extracted
 * from the canvas so the *identical* physics can run headlessly — the layout
 * benchmark (`scripts/graph-layout-bench.ts`) measures the same forces the
 * user sees, not a reimplementation that could drift.
 *
 * {@link applyLayoutForces} is idempotent: it (re)creates every force from the
 * given config, so the canvas uses it both for initial setup and for
 * hot-applying slider changes. The density profile is applied *inside* —
 * callers pass raw baseline values plus the visible-node count, which makes it
 * impossible for a caller to forget the density scaling.
 *
 * Free of Svelte and Pixi; depends only on d3-force and the pure tuning
 * functions in graphUtils.
