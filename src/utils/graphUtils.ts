 *
 * Each kind's size encodes exactly one thing, so it stays unambiguous:
 *
 * - **Notes** encode connectedness (degree), on a log curve under a hard cap —
 *   degrees are small and heavy-tailed, and past a point "very connected" is
 *   all a size can say.
 * - **Collapsed topics** encode *member count* — how many notes the bubble
 *   stands for, the natural "how big is this area of my vault" reading.
 *   Connectivity is deliberately NOT in the radius: rolled-up edge width
 *   already carries it, and encoding it twice left member count encoded
 *   nowhere.
 *
 * Topics follow the bubble-chart convention: circle **area** is proportional
 * to member count, so radius grows with √members. The scale is normalized
 * **per vault** — `√(members / largestTopicSize)` maps the biggest topic in
 * the current segmentation to the ceiling and everything else to its true
 * share of that, between the floor and the ceiling. The normalizer is stamped
 * on the node at merge time from ALL topics, not just the collapsed ones, so a
 * bubble never changes size because a *different* topic was expanded.
 *
 * Why not a fixed curve: an earlier version used a saturating
 * `√n / (√n + halfPoint)` with the half-point tuned on a few-hundred-note test
 * corpus (~36 notes). Real vaults have topics of 1000–2000 notes, where that
 * curve was already flat: an 8-note topic drew at a third the size of a
 * 1000-note one, and 1000 vs 2000 were indistinguishable. Any fixed constant
 * fails the same way for *some* vault size — only the vault's own maximum can
 * anchor the scale.
 *
 * The auto-tuned `nodeSize` (see {@link autoNodeSize}) is still the base for
 * every kind: note radii sit on it directly, and the topic floor/ceiling are
 * offsets from it, so folding a vault doesn't change the sizing regime.

 * squeeze produced tight solid blobs floating far apart). So the forces that
 * act on only one of the scales carry the asymmetry:
 *
 * - **spacing** follows the spread factor directly.
 * - **charge** follows √spread when spreading and spread^0.35 when
 *   compacting — charge acts on both scales at once
 *   (it separates notes within a cluster *and* pushes clusters apart), so
 *   scaling it fully squeezed cluster interiors on big graphs and flung
 *   unlinked satellites to the horizon on small ones. Softened, it keeps more
 *   note-to-note breathing room at high density and calmer satellites at low.
 * - **center** strengthens on dense graphs, supra-quadratically in the
 *   compaction (exponent 2.5, capped 2.2× — the cap was 2.8 until the layout
 *   benchmark showed the extra pull compressing cluster *interiors* about as
 *   hard as cohesion itself, right when gaps sat at the tight end of their
 *   band already) — it's the only inward force an
 *   unlinked node feels, and negligible against local forces inside a
 *   cluster, so it closes inter-cluster gaps without compressing anything.
 *   Steep because the pull must *outpace* the compaction: a linear response
 *   barely engaged before the spread floor bound it, and clusters still
 *   floated far apart. Below the reference density it relaxes instead
 *   (floored at 0.55): on a sparse graph centering is what holds the few
 *   nodes in a knot, and there is no crowding for it to counteract.
 * - **cohesion** relaxes on dense graphs, faster than spacing (spread^1.8,
 *   floored at 0.4) — it is the intra-cluster crush, and letting clusters
 *   expand fills the very gaps the center pull is closing. Never strengthened
 *   above 1×.
 *

 * defaults are the behaviour at "normal" vault size.
