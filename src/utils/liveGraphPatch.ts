/**
 * Live Graph Patching
 *
 * Incremental updates for an open smart graph (issue #404). While the graph
 * view is open, vault changes are folded into the existing `GraphData` in
 * place instead of rebuilding everything — the expensive derivations (full
 * semantic scan, Leiden) are replaced by targeted equivalents:
 *
 * - {@link applyWikiPatch} swaps in a freshly built wiki structure while
 *   preserving surviving semantic edges and per-node presentation state.
 * - {@link queryNoteSemanticEdges} re-queries the live vault index for just
 *   one note's chunks instead of re-running the batch neighbour search.
 * - {@link voteNodeCommunity} assigns a note to the community that dominates
 *   its neighbours (the same vote as the bridge heuristic) instead of
 *   re-running Leiden.
 *
 * Everything here is pure over its inputs (the store interface is injected)
 * so it unit-tests without Obsidian. The view layer owns event debouncing,
 * drift counting, and when to fall back to a full Leiden run.

 * links resolving against a newly created note) out of vault events would be
 * far more fragile than rebuilding it. What's preserved from `current` is

 *
 * - semantic edges whose endpoints both survive (a pair the user has since
 *   linked by hand loses its inferred edge — the authored link supersedes it),
 * - per-node presentation state (colour, cluster, highlight) so topics don't
 *   flash away while the incremental re-vote runs.
