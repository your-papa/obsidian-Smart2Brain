    On a phone the popover was the wrong modality outright: it covered ~76% of
    the viewport it floated over, hung from the least reachable edge, and gave
    a drag-and-watch control (granularity) nothing to watch. The sheet keeps
    the graph visible above it and puts the controls under the thumb.

    Opens at the peek detent, where Topics — the granularity slider and
    inferred links — is what you get; drag up for the topic list and the rest.
