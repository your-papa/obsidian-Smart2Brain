// `get_all_tags` omits tags that occur only in private notes (a tag name is itself
// content). Indexing skips them (`VectorStoreService`) and the graph withholds their
// titles from topic labelling.
//
// Three routes still expose a private path, so the note narrows to those rather than
// making the old blanket "names are always visible" claim:
//   1. Workspace context blocks — `[Currently visible notes]`, `[Selected text from
//      <path>]`, `[Graph-selected notes]` are appended to the outgoing message in
//      `chatStore.augmentWithVisibleNotes` with no privacy check. This is the one worth
//      warning about: it is silent, and the selection block carries the selected *text*,
//      not just the path.
//   2. Verbatim content of a *non-private* file — a public note (or `.chat` transcript,
//      which is gated by its own path, not by what it quotes) that contains
//      `[[Private Note]]` passes that name through as ordinary body text.
//   3. `exec_<plugin>` integrations, which bypass the filter wholesale — already covered
//      by `IntegrationPrivacyWarningModal` at enable time, so it is not repeated here.
// Attachments also bypass the filter, but attaching is an explicit user act on a named
// file, so it is not a surprise the way (1) is.
